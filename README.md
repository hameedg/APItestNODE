POSTMAN TEST API
you can clone this repo as this would provide you the starter files with which you can be able to understand the following tests:
    1.GET/ this request is usually same as browser request 
    2.POST/ this posts the data of your own created or dummy in json.
                json: javascript object notation is as simple as XML where in it is written in,
                "key":"value" pair
